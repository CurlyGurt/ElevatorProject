Downsides: Buttons are staggered when there is plenty of space to place them vertically. Buttons are placed in a way that it is awkward for an average height person to operate them.

Upsides: Buttons give instantaneous feedback in the form of light surrounding the pressed button. Button light goes out when desired floor is reached and a tone is played.
