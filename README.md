Upsides: Buttons give instantaneous feedback in the form of light surrounding the pressed button. Button light goes out when desired floor is reached and a tone is played. Physical buttons with braille for visually impaired users. Buttons are placed in a way that wheel-chair bound users are able to reach them.

Downsides: Buttons are staggered when there is plenty of space to place them vertically. Buttons are placed in a way that it is awkward for an average height person to operate them. Call, Door Close, etc, buttons are oddly placed and are too close to the numbered buttons.
