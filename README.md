Upsides: Buttons give instantaneous feedback in the form of light surrounding the pressed button. Button light goes out when desired floor is reached and a tone is played. Physical buttons with braille for visually impaired users. Buttons are placed in a way that wheel-chair bound users are able to reach them.

Downsides: Buttons are staggered when there is plenty of space to place them vertically. Buttons are placed in a way that it is awkward for an average height person to operate them. Call, Door Close, etc, buttons are oddly placed and are too close to the numbered buttons.

# Further Discussion
Common and Rare uses: I commonly only need to press one of the numbered buttons to arrive on my desired floor. On more rare occasions, I will press the Door Open button if I hear someone trying to make their way to the elevator; or sometimes I might press the Door Close button if I am in a hurry. This specific interface works well enough since there are so few floors in this building, but you do end up having to think about it for a split second to ensure that you are pressing the correct button.

Common Sequence of actions: A typical user will usually use this elevator by first pressing the call button just outside. They will then get into the elevator and press the number of their desired floor. Finally, the doors will close and the elevator will stop at each floor that was pressed.
